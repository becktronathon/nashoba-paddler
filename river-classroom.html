            Groups of students utilize canoes to study the Nashua and Squannacook Rivers led by trained canoeing guide/ naturalists. The
            Nashua has a rich history of cultural changes and ecological restoration. It is a nationally acclaimed model of successful
            environmental activism. Many schools have found it to be a tremendous educational resource and a wonderful laboratory for
            water/river studies/watershed programs.
